The data analysis project, in the scope of Machine
Learning Basic Principles course, focuses on multiclass classification
to identify songs’ genre using custom subset of the Million
Song Dataset [1], and the labels obtained from AllMusic.com [2].
During the project, 3 differnt methods were used to optimze and
improve the accuracy of results namely, ’K Nearest Neighbours
(KNN) with Low Dimensional Embedding’, ’Multinomial Logistic
Regression’ and ’One vs All (OvA) Logistic Regression’. The
very first method ’KNN with LDE’ employs Principal Component
Analysis [5] to extract useful features out of the high-dimensional
dataset and then uses KNN algorithm to create target clusters.
While Multinomial and OvA method use probablistic models to
classify target classes where the main difference occurs in the
modeling assumptions behind each of the two models.
