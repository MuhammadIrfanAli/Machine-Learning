For the availble dataset, 

1) a linear predictor was learned using using squared error loss.
2) A test set was chosen by copying N = 10 randomly selected data points (x(i); y(i)) out of the validation dataset.
Then prediction error was evaluated by computing the empirical risk
3) Above step was repeated for k=100 times and histogram plotted
